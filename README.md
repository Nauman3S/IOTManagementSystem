## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains

- Backend
- RPiClient Software
- Client auto-Installer script
- Detailed instructions

for IoTManagement System.



## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on you raspberry pi.

### Prerequisites

Turn on your Raspberry Pi and execute the following commands

```
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt upgrade
```

## RPiClient Installation <a name = "Installation"></a>


### Pre-configured Image

1.  [Download Raspberry Pi iamge with RPiClient-rs pre-configured](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FYrVbhk5LQBW3ekg3gABJCJOfhAbjY2a/view?usp=sharing) and flash it to your Raspberry Pi.

2.  ssh into the Raspberry Pi and execute the following command to get the MAC Address:

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status RPiClient-rs.service

### Responses

Many API endpoints return the JSON representation of the resources created or edited. However, if an invalid request is submitted, or some other error occurs, Gophish returns a JSON response in the following format:

```javascript
{
  "status"  : int,
  "message" : string
}
```
The `message` attribute contains a message commonly used to indicate errors or to return the logged status/

The `status` attribute describes if the transaction was successful or not.


### Status Codes

IoTManagementSystem Backend returns the following status codes in its API:

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | `OK` |
| 201 | `CREATED` |
| 400 | `BAD REQUEST` |
| 404 | `NOT FOUND` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` |

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1.  [Download Raspberry Pi iamge with RPiClient-rs pre-configured](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FYrVbhk5LQBW3ekg3gABJCJOfhAbjY2a/view?usp=sharing) and flash it to your Raspberry Pi.
2.  ssh into the Raspberry Pi and execute the following command to get the MAC Address:

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status RPiClient-rs.service
      ```

![logs](logs.png)

3.  Add the device with the MAC Address collected in the previous step to the database using addDevice API endpoint mentioned above
4.  Interact with the device with using MAC Address, or interact with all the devices in the system by using `all` in devices parameter of the API.


## Test <a name = "test"></a>

Use [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) to test the remote communication over the internet. You can run MQTT Explorer or any computer placed anywhere on the internet.

Install and Open MQTT Explorer

1.  Add a new connection with following details

![sc1](artwork/br0.png)

2.  Then add follwoing advaced options

![sc2](artwork/br1.png)

3.  ssh into the Raspberry Pi and execute the following command to get the MAC Address:

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status RPiClient-rs.service
      ```

![Logs](logs.png)

4.  Then you can publish to various topics and see the response on the same screen. You can get the topics list from the [MQTT Topic Details](#mqtt) section above.
