### Responses

Many API endpoints return the JSON representation of the resources created or edited. However, if an invalid request is submitted, or some other error occurs, Gophish returns a JSON response in the following format:

```javascript
{
  "status"  : int,
  "message" : string
}
```
The `message` attribute contains a message commonly used to indicate errors or to return the logged status/

The `status` attribute describes if the transaction was successful or not.


### Status Codes

IoTManagementSystem Backend returns the following status codes in its API:

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | `OK` |
| 201 | `CREATED` |
| 400 | `BAD REQUEST` |
| 404 | `NOT FOUND` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` |

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1.  [Download Raspberry Pi iamge with RPiClient-rs pre-configured](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JjKgjd-HqMF4WDyalsfsEwI3Kb5WTj4X?usp=sharing) and flash it to your Raspberry Pi.
2.  ssh into the Raspberry Pi and execute the following command to get the MAC Address:

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status RPiClient-rs.service
      ```

![logs](artwork/logs.png)

3.  Add the device with the MAC Address collected in the previous step to the database using addDevice API endpoint mentioned above
4.  Interact with the device with using MAC Address, or interact with all the devices in the system by using `all` in devices parameter of the API.

### Running Services

There are two systemd services running in the background:

1. `RPiClient-rs`
2. `RPiClient-rs-user-script`

The first one is the Client program managing all sort of updates and communication related stuff while the second one is the user-script sent by the user to the device. Both of these service recover themselves from any errors automatically and both of them start running on the system boot.

## Test <a name = "test"></a>

Use [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) to test the remote communication over the internet. You can run MQTT Explorer or any computer placed anywhere on the internet.

Install and Open MQTT Explorer

1.  Add a new connection with following details

![sc1](artwork/br0.png)

2.  Then add follwoing advaced options

![sc2](artwork/br1.png)

3.  ssh into the Raspberry Pi and execute the following command to get the MAC Address:

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status RPiClient-rs.service
      ```

![Logs](artwork/logs.png)

4.  Then you can publish to various topics and see the response on the same screen. You can get the topics list from the [MQTT Topic Details](#mqtt) section above.
